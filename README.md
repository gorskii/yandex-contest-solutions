# Yandex Contest solutions repo

Here I store all the code I wrote solving problems during Yandex algorithm trainings. Lectures and problem sets are available here: [first](https://yandex.ru/yaintern/algorithm-training_1), [second](https://yandex.ru/yaintern/algorithm-training).

I also use this repo to store problems I have solved or attempted to solve during Yandex backend internship preparation. Training problem sets are available [here](https://contest.yandex.ru/contest/8458/enter/) and [here](https://contest.yandex.ru/contest/28412/enter).

It's updated as soon as new problems are solved.
